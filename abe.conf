# Config file for Abe.

# dbtype and connect-args are required.
# If not configured to run under FastCGI, host OR port is required.

# "NAME=VALUE" and "NAME VALUE" are equivalent.  Just "NAME" sets
# value to True.  Values of the form "..." or [...]  or {...} are
# parsed as extended JSON, as are the values true, false, and null.
# Abe extends JSON syntax to allow strings to contain control
# characters (tab, LF, and CR) and to allow comments (from # to end of
# line) between tokens.

# "NAME += VALUE" appends VALUE to an array or updates an object
# defined by NAME.  Hyphen in NAME is read as underscore, so
# "connect_args" and "connect-args" are synonymous.  Later values
# override earlier ones (unless using "+=").

# All values may be passed as command-line arguments by preceding NAME
# with "--".  Example: "python -m Abe.abe --upgrade --dbtype=sqlite3
# --connect-args=abe.sqlite --port 2750".

# dbtype is the name of a Python module.  connect-args are arguments
# to pass to the module's "connect" function.  Consult the module's
# documentation for values.  The user needs permission to create
# tables.  Consult your database documentation on how to configure a
# database.  See also README.txt.

# PostgreSQL example; see also README-POSTGRES.txt:
#dbtype = psycopg2
#connect-args = { "database": "abe" }

# MySQL example; see also README-MYSQL.txt:
#dbtype MySQLdb
#connect-args {"user":"root","db":"abe"}

# SQLite3 example:
#dbtype = sqlite3
#connect-args = abe.sqlite

# Oracle example:
#dbtype=cx_Oracle
#connect-args=user/pass@SID

# ODBC examples.  Don't use the same schema via ODBC and non-ODBC!
#dbtype = pyodbc
#connect-args = DSN=Abe;PWD=B!tc0iN;
#connect-args = DRIVER={ORACLE};DB=ORCL;UID=abe;PWD=Bitcoin;
#connect-args = DRIVER={PostgreSQL ANSI};Database=abe;

# Workaround for ODBC drivers that begin in autocommit mode:
#connect-args {"":"DRIVER={PostgreSQL ANSI};Database=abe;","autocommit":false}

# IBM DB2 example:
#dbtype = ibm_db_dbi
#connect-args {"dsn":"DATABASE=abe;UID=db2inst1;PWD=B!tCo1N","conn_options":{"102":0}}

# Specify port and/or host to serve HTTP instead of FastCGI:
#port 2750
#host localhost

# Specify no-serve to exit immediately after importing block files:
#no-serve

# Specify no-load to start abe server without ever loading the
# blockchain - this is useful if you have a dedicated instance loading
# blocks into your Abe database.
#no-load

# "upgrade" tells Abe to upgrade database objects automatically after
# code updates:
#upgrade
#
# Sometimes upgrades fail and leave the database unusable.  Sometimes
# upgrades take several minutes or longer.  You may get an idea of the
# time required by looking at comments near the bottom of
# Abe/upgrade.py.  For example, if your schema version is Abe18 and
# you are upgrading to schema version Abe19, the relevant lines are:
#
#    ('Abe18',   add_block_num_tx),       # Seconds
#    ('Abe18.1', add_block_ss_destroyed), # Seconds
#    ('Abe18.2', init_block_tx_sums),     # 5 minutes
#    ('Abe18.3', replace_chain_summary),  # Fast
#
# In this case, you could expect a 5-minute upgrade.  The following
# SQL shows the current schema version, provided that it is at least
# Abe13:
#
#    SELECT configvar_value FROM configvar
#     WHERE configvar_name = 'schema_version'
#
# "python -m Abe.abe -v" shows the schema version that the software
# requires.  Sometimes you can upgrade a live database by running
# "python -m Abe.abe --config YOUR_ABE_CONFIG --no-serve --upgrade"
# but this often results in server errors and may sometimes corrupt
# the data.  It is best if the upgrade process has exclusive access to
# the database.

# Include another configuration file, relative to this one's directory.
#config ../secret/abe.conf

# Add or replace object fields.  This example assumes connect-args
# previously held an object such as { "user": "abe" }.
#connect-args += { "password": "B!tc0iN" }

# datadir tells Abe where and how to find block data.  datadir is
# structured as a JSON array of objects: [ { ... }, ... ] You can add
# to the list of sources with datadir+=[...] or replace it by using
# datadir=[...].  Each object { ... } specifies a data source using
# named parameters, so the general form of datadir is:

# datadir+=[{"dir1name1":"dir1param1","dir1name2":"dir1param2",...},
#           {"dir2name1":"dir2param1","dir2name2":"dir2param2",...},
#           ...]

# The most important parameter is "dirname" and is the filesystem
# directory containing your bitcoin.conf file.  (Bitcoind can use a
# non-default directory if you pass it -datadir=<dirname>.)

# Besides "dirname", most coins need the "chain" parameter, which is
# the chain name as shown in web pages.  Also, each datadir needs a
# "policy" to define the block and transaction format, since this
# information is not encoded in the blockfiles.

# If "policy" is not given in datadir, it defaults to the chain name,
# but for new coins, a "policy" parameter is required.  Run
# "python -m Abe.abe --list-policies" to see the possibilities, and
# "python -m Abe.abe --show-policy POLICY" for information about
# POLICY.  When in doubt, look for the name of a coin on which the new
# coin is based, or a name suggestive of its distinctive features such
# as proof-of-work hash algorithm.  If no policy works, see the
# modules in Abe/Chain for examples.  Each module there implements a
# policy.

# New coins typically need a new "address_version", see doc/FAQ.html.

#datadir += [{
#        "dirname": "/home/bitcoin/.bitcoin",
#        "loader": "rpc",    # See the comments for default-loader below.
#        "chain": "Bitcoin"
#      }]

#        "dirname": "/home/jtobey/.novacoin",
#        "chain": "NewCoin",   # Display as "NewCoin" ...
#        "policy": "NovaCoin"  # ... but use the "NovaCoin" loader.
#      }]

# datadir can supply information about new currencies.
# Note that "address_version" is a byte string: the byte (or, perhaps
# someday, several bytes) preceding the public key hash before base-58
# conversion.  Example:
#
#datadir += [{
#        "dirname": "/home/weeds/testnet",
#        "chain":   "Weeds",
#        "code3":   "WDS",

# Use default-loader=blkfile to force Abe to load data by scanning

#
#     * HTTP access to bitcoind (SSL is not yet supported.)
