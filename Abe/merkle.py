#    WARNING! If you're reading this because you're learning about crypto
#    and/or designing a new system that will use merkle trees, keep in mind
#    that the following merkle tree algorithm has a serious flaw related to
#    duplicate txids, resulting in a vulnerability (CVE-2012-2459).
#    The reason is that if the number of hashes in the list at a given level
#    is odd, the last one is duplicated before computing the next level (which
#    is unusual in Merkle trees). This results in certain sequences of
#    transactions leading to the same merkle root. For example, these two
#    trees:
#                 A               A
#               /  \            /   \
#             B     C         B       C
#            / \    |        / \     / \
#           D   E   F       D   E   F   F
#          / \ / \ / \     / \ / \ / \ / \
#          1 2 3 4 5 6     1 2 3 4 5 6 5 6
#    for transaction lists [1,2,3,4,5,6] and [1,2,3,4,5,6,5,6] (where 5 and
#    6 are repeated) result in the same root hash A (because the hash of both
#    of (F) and (F,F) is C).
#    The vulnerability results from being able to send a block with such a
#    transaction list, with the same merkle root, and the same block hash as
#    the original without duplication, resulting in failed validation. If the
#    receiving node proceeds to mark that block as permanently invalid
#    however, it will fail to accept further unmodified (and thus potentially
#    valid) versions of the same block. We defend against this by detecting
#    the case where we would hash two identical hashes at the end of the list
#    together, and treating that identically to the block having an invalid
#    merkle root. Assuming no double-SHA256 collisions, this will detect all
#    known ways of changing the transactions without affecting the merkle
#    root.
